Welcome to Davey Jones Locker.

This modpack is in it's early stages and will be using HQM along with modtweaker and minetweaker to create a customized experience with alot of adventuring to be had.

Like I said this is very early and I am open to suggestions.

Premise

	You have died and are now trying to find your way back to the overworld.  There will be Multiple custom made dimensions with ores, materials and items only available there.  Upon completing the quests for that dimesion you will gain two link books and some crystals to make a portal to the next dimension and a portal back to the one you just completed.  This pack will take time to complete and not all dimensions will be terrible (at first)
  
	I plan on having some items uncraftable but only available by completing quests and adventuring.  There will be custom world gen buildings to adventure in that will be fairly rare.  These may have loot or may have actual machines and other items you can use to further yourself along the journey.
  
  Please give me any feedback as I progress this modpack.
